1/ libselinux-python needs to be installed locally, to be able to change the tower_license file
yum -y install libselinux-python

2/ create a file called "tower_license.json" containing the Tower license in this folder.
Make sure your license can manage enough nodes. Each participants uses 2 nodes (localhost and an external IP)

3/ Copy inventory.example to inventory and fill in the missing parameters

Some parameters can be found from Azure CLI as follows:
# from Shell in Azure
# PS Azure:\> az ad sp create-for-rbac --query '{"client_id": appId, "secret": password, "tenant": tenant}'
# {
#   "client_id": "***",
#   "secret": "***",
#   "tenant": "***"
# }


4/ Run "ansible-playbook setup_ansible_hands_on_lab.yml
   to save time when tower is already installed: 
   ansible-playbook tower_setup_azure.yml --skip-tags=initial_azure_setup,install_tower

5/ The playbook will create (if it does not exist yet) an id_rsa file. Use this file to connect to the Tower VMs (as admin_user)

6/ The playbook creates a ansible_dryrun.sh script. This can be used for monitoring load on the tower VMs, testing Azure quota's, etc. Tear down the setup and redeploy after using this script.
